<h2 id="creating-a-project"> Creating an SMTP Express Project</h2>

An SMTP Express project is an instance of a connection to an SMTP server. To create a project, you don't have to worry about setting up SMTP credentials as we will provide you with an internal server configuration.

To create a project, [sign in](https://smtpexpress.com/signin) on the SMTP Express website, you will be redirected to your project dashboard. by default it's empty. Click on the **New Project** button to get started.

Provide a name that's related to your project, then click on **Create my project**.

<Note>When you create a project, we provide you with a project ID, a project secret and a sender address. This address will be used to send your mail.</Note>

You will find all this data on your project overview page.

<Warning>It's important to remember that if you have not added a domain to this project, you can only send emails from your sender address; otherwise, it will fail.</Warning>

<h2 id="using-sdk-or-api-request"> Using Javascript SDK </h2>

The simplest way to get started with SMTP Express is through our developer tools; you can also make a direct API call to our standalone service. This is useful if you do not want to install anything.

```bash
npm install smtpexpress
```

Next, create an API client that takes an object as an argument. It's important to know that your `projectSecret` is used as your bearer token when interacting with our APIs.
```javascript ApiClient.js
import { createClient } from "smtpexpress"

const smtpexpressClient = createClient({
  projectId: "<INSERT_PROJECT_ID>",
  projectSecret: "<INSERT_PROJECT_SECRET>"
});
```


<h2 id="quick-send-with-api-call">Quick Send with API call</h2>

You can use this endpoint to make direct call to SMTP Express.

```shell cURL
curl --location 
--request POST 'https://api.smtpexpress.com/send' 
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <INSERT_PROJECT_SECRET>'
```
