An SMTP Express Project is now synonymous to spinning up your own mail server. Supercharged with Inboxing, Marketing and Transactional email functions out-of-the-box.

Step 1. Sign in to your [dashboard](https://smtpexpress.com/signin) and click the `New Project` button in the navigation header.


### Using our Internal SMTP server

By default, all projects created on our platform get an email address in the format `<project>@smtpexpress.email`. This email address can be used to send and receive emails on behalf of that project.
