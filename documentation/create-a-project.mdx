An SMTP Express Project is now synonymous to spinning up your own mail server. Supercharged with Inboxing, Marketing and Transactional email functions out-of-the-box.

Step 1. Sign in to your [dashboard](https://smtpexpress.com/signin) and click the `New Project` button in the navigation header.

### Using our Internal SMTP server
To establish a secure connection to an SMTP server, you would typically need the host, its port, a username, and a password to log into the server. Services like Amazon SES, Zeptomail, Sendgrid, and Mailtrap offer dedicated SMTP servers for your domains and If your email providers allow you to send emails over their SMTP servers, that is also a viable option.

We have simplified this process for you, now you can create a project and focus on sending emails while we take care of spinning up an SMTP server for you. We also provide a sender address in the format **sender@projects.smtpexpress.com**, this address will be used to send emails from the project.
