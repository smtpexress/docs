{/* Project secret is an important part of the SMTP Express authentication mechanism, please ensure you do not expose your secret to anyone when you get them. Failure to do so might lead to your project being compromised. 

## Authenticate with Project Secret

All our APIs are secured using bearer tokens in the form of project secrets, which helps us add an extra layer of security to your project. This secret can only be used to perform actions within a project scope. However, a project can have multiple project secrets depending on the environment in which it is being used. 

You can also create a new project secret that is domain-specific under a project. This means that, when you add an organization domain **@smtpexpress.com** to this secret, any mail sent that is not from this address will fail. This list of domains can be modified at any time from your project credentials page. 

## Managing a Project Secret

When you create a project, a **Project ID** and **Project Secret** will be generated for you by default, go to your project overview, and you will see them. 

<Warning>
Ensure to protect your Project Secret. Failure to do so might lead to authorized access.
</Warning>

### Create Multiple Project Secret
To create multiple secrets for a project, click on the right anchor on the project secret or navigate to the Credentials page. Click on Create Secret.
You will need to add some information before creating a secret.

<ul>
   <li>**Secret Name** : This is a name associated to your project.</li>
   <li>**Authorized Origins**: this is the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the hosts that are authorized to send emails with this project secret.</li>
</ul>

When you are done, Click on Create Secret. You can also modify this secret to allow multiple authorized origins at any point in time.  */}
