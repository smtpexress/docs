## What is SMTP Express?

SMTP Express is a complete emailing suite built to meet the promotional, transactional and inboxing needs of businesses. Powering all these is our email delivery service; <b style={{color: '#F2B311'}}> The Send API.</b> 

With the Send API, businesses can send emails programatically from their applications (Website, Mobile App, CI/CD Pipeline). We do this by letting you establish SMTP connections over HTTPS, eliminating the need for a backend server.

This documentation has been designed to help you get started with SMTP Express and explore its features in-depth. Let's get started!
