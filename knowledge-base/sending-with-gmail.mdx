Some months ago, I created a guide for [SMTP Express](https://smtpexpress.com/) on sending emails from React with SMTP Express. This [blog](https://blog.openreplay.com/sending-emails-from-react-with-smtp-express/) features all the use cases you will need when building a feature that requires transactional emails.Â 

Since then, there's been an update on the [website](https://beta.smtpexpress.com/). Users can now connect their personalized email with SMTP Express, and send emails directly to recipients.

## How does this work?

This is done by remotely connecting to your SMTP Host address from within your project domain settings. To get there, when you create a new project, you have the option to choose between a business dashboard and a developer dashboard. Select the developer dashboard and click domains on the right navigation pane.

You should be presented with a screen that looks like this.

In this image, I have already connected my account. but I will walk you through how to set up yours.

Click on the "..." icon beside the connect domain, and now click on connect server. You will be presented with a form that requires you to input your domain name and SMTP credentials.

In our case, this domain is "gmail.com" and the hostname is "smtp.gmail.com.". Next,, you will need to provide a a port number, username, and password.


## How do I get my password?
You will have to generate your app password from your Gmail account. This password will enable a remote connection with your Gmail account. to do that, follow this [link](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) it will take you directly to your

If you add a name and generate your password, a modal will pop up containing a 16-character string code for your password.
Head over to your developer dashboard and add this password. Then, click on Connect to this SMTP server. 

Now that you have connected a server, let's head over to quickly send a message and test out our new setup.

The image clearly shows that I have selected my new domain, and I have also added all the information needed to send a new email.  If everything goes fine, Your email should be in your inbox.

This guide helps our users understand the new feature coming onboard at SMTP Express, We are including support for businesses to be able to send broadcast email, helping them in marketing campaigns. Also, we are adding a host of other features to help developers send transaction emails. Exciting times ahead!
