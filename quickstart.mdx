## 1. Creating a Project
Simply put, a project is where all your emailing activities take place. Of course, you'll need to [sign up for an account](https://smtpexpress.com/signin) before you can proceed. Once signed in, click on the `New Project` button, provide a name that's related to your project and hit enter.

## 2. Email Delivery with Quick Send
At this point, you should be seeing your project dashboard. Click on the `Quick Send` button and compose your message. Feel free to use your personal email as the recipient. When you are done, hit enter and your mail will be sent right to your inbox. Easy right? 


## 3. Email Delivery with the Send API
For context, we provide you with a default sender address in the form of `<project>@smtpexpress.email` which you will recognize as the sender of the email you received. You can learn more about [changing your sender address.](https://smtpexpress.com/signin)

Navigate to your project overview where you will see your sender address alongside two other credentials; Your `Project ID` and your `Project Secret`.

For this example, we'll only be needing the project secret and of course, the sender address. Your project secret is needed to authorize your requests to the Send API and here's how you'd do that.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Javascript
// npm install javascript
import { createClient } from "smtpexpress"

const smtpexpressClient = createClient({
  projectId: "<INSERT_PROJECT_ID>",
  projectSecret: "<INSERT_PROJECT_SECRET>"
});

smtpexpressClient.sendApi.sendMail({
  subject: "My first email using the Send API",
  message: "Hello from the Express!"
  sender: {
    name: "SMTP Express User",
    email: "<INSERT_SENDER_ADDRESS>"
  },
  recipients: "<INSERT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>",
})
```

```shell cURL
curl -XPOST 'https://api.staging.smtpexpress.com/send'
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer <INSERT_PROJECT_SECRET>' 
 -H "Content-type: application/json" 
 -d '{
 "subject": "My first email using the Send API",
  "message": "Hello from the Express!",
  "sender": {
    "name": "SMTP Express User",
    "email": "<INSERT_SENDER_ADDRESS>"
  },
  "recipients": "<INSERT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>"
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

<Check>Your mail is on the express</Check>
